Abstract:

```
The objective of this thesis was to implement a modular framework that facilitates
the integration of diverse rigging and retargeting methodologies, thereby enabling
a comparative analysis of their quality and performance. The primary goal was to
create a tool that automates or streamlines the process of creating a virtual character
just from a scan. Therefore the open-source 3D framework CrossForge, developed
at the GDV professorship, served as the basis for this work. As a result, a modular
processing pipeline was created, incorporating a versatile application programming
interface (API) that enables the integration and evaluation of diverse algorithmic
implementations and thereby streamlining the efficient creation of prototypes. Fur-
thermore, a sophisticated user interface has been developed that provides other re-
searchers with the opportunity to easily integrate further skinning and retargeting
methods. Thus, the implemented modules facilitate the comparison, and combina-
tion of various retargeting algorithms, as well as the evaluation of their correctness
including potential advantages and drawbacks.

The presented thesis employs a highly adaptable kinematic chain-based retargeting approach built from the ground up.
This approach involves retargeting motion data on a per chain basis,
followed by choosing different inverse kinematics solvers for motion cleanup on the same armature.
